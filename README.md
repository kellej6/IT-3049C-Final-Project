## MatchIt Game

### Description:

 MatchIt is a game that challenges the player's 
 knowledge about capitals of the countries worldwide. 
 Clicking the START button will trigger a countdown
 timer, show the country to guess the capital for, the flag of this country, and a blank field where the 
 player can enter letters. A player has a limit of
 two minutes to guess as many capitals as she/he can.
 To enter the capital name the player can either use the virtual keyboard provided or type the letter in text box. For each wrong alphabet guessed, a part of Hangman is drawn in the canvas. If the player gets
 the right capital, the score will be incremented
 by one point. When the time is expired the player can
 try again by clicking the PLAY AGAIN button which 
 will clear the canvas, capital field, the country 
 field, the flag, and reset the timer.
